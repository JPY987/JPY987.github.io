    <h1>Your Rights</h1>

    <h3>What to do if ICE stops you in public: </h3>
    <ul> 
    <li> <b> Stay Calm </b> - Don't run, argue, or fight the agent.  </li>
     <li> <b> Ask, "Am I free to go?" </b> - If the answer is yes, you can walk away. If not, invoke your right to remain silent and ask to speak with a lawyer </li>
     <li> <b> You have the right to remain silent </b> - You do not have to answer any questions, including where you were born or how you entered the U.S.  </li> 
     <li> <b> ICE can only search you with consent </b> - If an agent tries to search your belongings, say "I do not consent to this search." </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> What to do if ICE comes to your house:  </h3>
    <ul> 
      <li> <b> Do NOT open the door </b> - ICE cannot enter your house without a valid judicial warrant. </li>
      <li> <b> Ask ICE to see the warrant </b> - Ask the agent to slide the warrant under the door or show it through a window to verify its validity. </li>
      <li> <b> You have the right to remain silent </b> - You do not have to answer ICE's questions. </li>
      <li> <b> Do NOT sign anything </b> - Speak with a lawyer before signing anything. Signing documents may waive your rights or lead to deportation. </li>
      <li> <b> ICE may lie to get you to open the door </b> - Agents often pretend to be local police conducting an investigation. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> What to do after an ICE arrest: </h3>
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        <b> Do NOT answer questions </b> - You have the right to remain silent.
      </li>

      <li> 
        <b> Do NOT sign anything </b> - Many ICE documents are designed to speed up deportation. Always consult an attorney first.

        <b> Ask to speak to a lawyer </b> - The government will NOT provide you with a free lawyer, but you have the right to hire one. 
      </li>

      <li> 
        <b> To find a detained loved one </b> - use the <a href = "https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search"> ICE Detainee Locator tool.  </a>
